psychotasks
===========
The basis of the engine can be found in the experiment.py and experiment_logger.py files. For the moment, you can find three tasks in the files:
* nback.py
* visual_search.py
* mental_rotation.py

The packages necessary to use this repository should be listed in requirements.txt. They can be installed using pip by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If some package is missing, please open an issue and I will add it to the requirements file.

All task can be run by the command `python alltask.py`. See the help for more details.


Code structure
==============

The code structure of this repository is temporary. It will be modified to facilitate the installation and the reading of the code in a little time.
